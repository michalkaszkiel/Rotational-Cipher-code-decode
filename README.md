Code inludes classes and strings methods which can encrypt the password consisted of lowercased english alphabet letters. I took an inspiration from Rotational Cipher exercise and decided to add my code which also decrypts the password. 


## Explanation

English alphabet consists of 26 characters which JavaScript transforms to index of 25. 
Cesar cipher class has its methods:

1. code()

* takes two arguments: 
    *       string which will be decrypted
    *       the offset, the shift distance chosen by an index heading left.
            Each letter is replaced by another letter of offset index located
            a little further in the alphabet.

2. decode()
* takes two arguments: 
    *       decoded password - analogically method decrypts previously coded password,
    *       the offset.
